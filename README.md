# **Welcome to my Github!** ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hi, I'm Pravesh im currently enrolled in the Python Software Engineering course through HyperionDev. I'm passionate about programming, problem-solving, and constantly learning to become a better software engineer, iâ€™m excited to share my progress with you. Feel free to check out my repositories, contributions, and projects as I grow through this learning experience.

## My Projects 

### String Manipulation 

>in this task, i was required to manipulate a string by applying various string operations using Pythonâ€™s built-in string methods. The goal was to demonstrate fundamental string manipulation techniques such as finding string length, replacing characters, slicing, and string concatenation

### numbers project 

>In this task, i created a Python program that takes input from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations on three integers, and outputs the results. The task focuses on input handling, integer manipulation, and applying fundamental arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Award project 

> in this task, I created a Python program that calculates the total time for a triathlon based on user input for swimming, cycling, and running times and determines the participant's award. The task focuses on input handling, arithmetic operations to sum event times, and applying conditional logic using if-elif-else statements to evaluate and display the appropriate award.

### While loop project

> In this task, I created a Python program that continually prompts the user to enter a number until -1 is entered to stop. The program uses a while loop to manage continuous input, excludes 0 and -1 from the calculations, and computes the average of the valid numbers entered. The task focuses on input validation, loop control, and arithmetic operations to calculate the average.

### Pattern project 

> In this task, I wrote a Python program to generate an arrow pattern using a for loop combined with if-else statements. Demonstrating skills in loop control, conditional logic, and formatted output to create the desired pattern.
